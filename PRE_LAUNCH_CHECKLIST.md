## ‚ö†Ô∏è MINOR ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Development Console Logs
**Status**: Low Priority - Production Impact: None
- Several `console.log` statements in development code
- These should be removed or conditionally disabled for production
- **Files**: useCamera.tsx, useMoments.tsx, useInteractions.tsx, and others

### TypeScript Type Safety
**Status**: Low Priority - Functional Impact: None  
- Some `any` types used in data handling (mostly in hooks)
- App is fully functional, but could benefit from stricter typing
- **Files**: useOptimizedQueries.tsx, useInteractions.tsx, useMoments.tsx

### Google Analytics Configuration
**Status**: Needs Update - Replace Placeholder
- Analytics measurement ID is placeholder: 'G-XXXXXXXXXX'
- **File**: useAnalytics.tsx (lines 23, 53)

## üöÄ PRODUCTION READINESS TASKS

### HIGH PRIORITY (Complete Before Launch)

1. **Google Analytics Setup**

   - [ ] Add production build optimization

5. **Monitoring Setup**
   - [ ] Set up error monitoring (e.g., Sentry)
   - [ ] Configure performance monitoring alerts
   - [ ] Set up uptime monitoring

### LOW PRIORITY (Future Enhancements)
